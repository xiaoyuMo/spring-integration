=== Metrics and Management

This section describes how to capture metrics for Spring Integration.
In recent versions, we have relied more on Micrometer (see http://micrometer.io), and we plan to use Micrometer even more in future releases.

[[configuring-metrics-capture]]
==== Configuring Metrics Capture

NOTE: Prior to version 4.2, metrics were only available when JMX was enabled.
See <<jmx>>.

To enable `MessageSource`, `MessageChannel`, and `MessageHandler` metrics, add an `<int:management/>` bean to the application context (in XML) or annotate one of your `@Configuration` classes with `@EnableIntegrationManagement` (in Java).
`MessageSource` instances maintain only counts, `MessageChannel` instances and `MessageHandler` instances maintain duration statistics in addition to counts.
See <<mgmt-channel-features>> and <<mgmt-handler-features>>, later in this chapter.

Doing so causes the automatic registration of the `IntegrationManagementConfigurer` bean in the application context.
Only one such bean can exist in the context, and, if registered manually via a `<bean/>` definition, it must have the bean name set to `integrationManagementConfigurer`.
This bean applies its configuration to beans after all beans in the context have been instantiated.

In addition to metrics, you can control debug logging in the main message flow.
In very high volume applications, even calls to `isDebugEnabled()` can be quite expensive with some logging subsystems.
You can disable all such logging to avoid this overhead.
Exception logging (debug or otherwise) is not affected by this setting.

The following listing shows the available options for controlling logging:

====
[source, xml]
----
<int:management
    default-logging-enabled="true" <1>
    default-counts-enabled="false" <2>
    default-stats-enabled="false" <3>
    counts-enabled-patterns="foo, !baz, ba*" <4>
    stats-enabled-patterns="fiz, buz" <5>
    metrics-factory="myMetricsFactory" /> <6>
----

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableIntegration
@EnableIntegrationManagement(
    defaultLoggingEnabled = "true", <1>
    defaultCountsEnabled = "false", <2>
    defaultStatsEnabled = "false", <3>
    countsEnabled = { "foo", "${count.patterns}" }, <4>
    statsEnabled = { "qux", "!*" }, <5>
    MetricsFactory = "myMetricsFactory") <6>
public static class ContextConfiguration {
...
}
----
====

<1> Set to `false` to disable all logging in the main message flow, regardless of the log system category settings.
Set to 'true' to enable debug logging (if also enabled by the logging subsystem).
Only applied if you have not explicitly configured the setting in a bean definition.
The default is `true`.

<2> Enable or disable count metrics for components that do not match one of the patterns in <4>.
Only applied if you have not explicitly configured the setting in a bean definition.
The default is `false`.

<3> Enable or disable statistical metrics for components that do not match one of the patterns in <5>.
Only applied if you have not explicitly configured the setting in a bean definition.
The default is 'false'.

<4> A comma-delimited list of patterns for beans for which counts should be enabled.
You can negate the pattern with `!`.
First match (positive or negative) wins.
In the unlikely event that you have a bean name starting with `!`, escape the `!` in the pattern.
For example, `\!something` positively matches a bean named `!something`.

<5> A comma-delimited list of patterns for beans for which statistical metrics should be enabled.
You can negate the pattern\ with `!`.
First match (positive or negative) wins.
In the unlikely event that you have a bean name starting with `!`, escape the `!` in the pattern.
`\!something` positively matches a bean named `!something`.
The collection of statistics implies the collection of counts.

<6> A reference to a `MetricsFactory`.
See <<mgmt-metrics-factory>>.

At runtime, counts and statistics can be obtained by calling `getChannelMetrics`, `getHandlerMetrics` and `getSourceMetrics` (all from the `IntegrationManagementConfigurer` class), which return `MessageChannelMetrics`, `MessageHandlerMetrics`, and `MessageSourceMetrics`, respectively.

See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/index.html[Javadoc] for complete information about these classes.

When JMX is enabled (see <<jmx>>), `IntegrationMBeanExporter` also exposes these metrics.

IMPORTANT:
`defaultLoggingEnabled`, `defaultCountsEnabled`, and `defaultStatsEnabled` are applied only if you have not explicitly configured the corresponding setting in a bean definition.

Starting with version 5.0.2, the framework automatically detects whether the application context has a single `MetricsFactory` bean and, if so, uses it instead of the default metrics factory.

[[micrometer-integration]]
==== Micrometer Integration

Starting with version 5.0.3, the presence of a https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer] `MeterRegistry` in the application context triggers support for Micrometer metrics in addition to the built-in metrics (note that built-in metrics will be removed in a future release).

IMPORTANT: Micrometer was first supported in version 5.0.2, but changes were made to the Micrometer `Meters` in version 5.0.3 to make them more suitable for use in dimensional systems.
Further changes were made in 5.0.4.
If you use Micrometer, a minimum of version 5.0.4 is recommended, since some of the changes in 5.0.4 were breaking API changes.

To use Micrometer, add one of the `MeterRegistry` beans to the application context.
If the `IntegrationManagementConfigurer` detects exactly one `MeterRegistry` bean, it configures a `MicrometerMetricsCaptor` bean with a name of `integrationMicrometerMetricsCaptor`.

For each `MessageHandler` and `MessageChannel`, timers are registered.
For each `MessageSource`, a counter is registered.

This only applies to objects that extend `AbstractMessageHandler`, `AbstractMessageChannel`, and `AbstractMessageSource` (which is the case for most framework components).

With Micrometer metrics, the `statsEnabled` flag has no effect, since statistics capture is delegated to Micrometer.
The `countsEnabled` flag controls whether the Micrometer `Meter` instances are updated when processing each message.

The `Timer` Meters for send operations on message channels have the following names or tags:

* `name`: `spring.integration.send`
* `tag`: `type:channel`
* `tag`: `name:<componentName>`
* `tag`: `result:(success|failure)`
* `tag`: `exception:(none|exception simple class name)`
* `description`: `Send processing time`

(A `failure` result with a `none` exception means the channel's `send()` operation returned `false`.)

The `Counter` Meters for receive operations on pollable message channels have the following names or tags:

* `name`: `spring.integration.receive`
* `tag`: `type:channel`
* `tag`: `name:<componentName>`
* `tag`: `result:(success|failure)`
* `tag`: `exception:(none|exception simple class name)`
* `description`: `Messages received`

The `Timer` Meters for operations on message handlers have the following names or tags:

* `name`: `spring.integration.send`
* `tag`: `type:handler`
* `tag`: `name:<componentName>`
* `tag`: `result:(success|failure)`
* `tag`: `exception:(none|exception simple class name)`
* `description`: `Send processing time`

The `Counter` meters for message sources have the following names/tags:

* `name`: `spring.integration.receive`
* `tag`: `type:source`
* `tag`: `name:<componentName>`
* `tag`: `result:success`
* `tag`: `exception:none`
* `description`: `Messages received`

In addition, there are three `Gauge` Meters:

* `spring.integration.channels`: The number of `MessageChannels` in the application.
* `spring.integration.handlers`: The number of `MessageHandlers` in the application.
* `spring.integration.sources`: The number of `MessageSources` in the application.

It is possible to customize the names and tags of `Meters` created by integration components by providing a subclass of `MicrometerMetricsCaptor`.
The https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/blob/master/spring-integration-core/src/test/java/org/springframework/integration/support/management/micrometer/MicrometerCustomMetricsTests.java[MicrometerCustomMetricsTests] test case shows a simple example of how to do that.
You can also further customize the meters by overloading the `build()` methods on builder subclasses.

[[mgmt-channel-features]]
==== `MessageChannel` Metric Features

These legacy metrics will be removed in a future release.
See <<micrometer-integration>>.

Message channels report metrics according to their concrete type.
If you are looking at a `DirectChannel`, you see statistics for the send operation.
If it is a `QueueChannel`, you also see statistics for the receive operation as well as the count of messages that are currently buffered by this `QueueChannel`.
In both cases, some metrics are simple counters (message count and error count), and some are estimates of averages of interesting quantities.
The algorithms used to calculate these estimates are described briefly in the following table.

.MessageChannel Metrics
[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Metric Type
| Example
| Algorithm

| Count
| Send Count
| Simple incrementer.
Increases by one when an event occurs.

| Error Count
| Send Error Count
| Simple incrementer.
Increases by one when an send results in an error.

| Duration
| Send Duration (method execution time in milliseconds)
| Exponential moving average with decay factor (ten by default).
Average of the method execution time over roughly the last ten (by default) measurements.

| Rate
| Send Rate (number of operations per second)
| Inverse of Exponential moving average of the interval between events with decay in time (lapsing over 60 seconds by default) and per measurement (last ten events by default).

| Error Rate
| Send Error Rate (number of errors per second)
| Inverse of exponential moving average of the interval between error events with decay in time (lapsing over 60 seconds by default) and per measurement (last ten events by default).

| Ratio
| Send Success Ratio (ratio of successful to total sends)
| Estimate the success ratio as the exponential moving average of the series composed of values (1 for success and 0 for failure, decaying as per the rate measurement over time and events by default).
The error ratio is: 1 - success ratio.

[[mgmt-handler-features]]
==== MessageHandler Metric Features

These legacy metrics will be removed in a future release.
See <<micrometer-integration>>.

The following table shows the statistics maintained for message handlers.
Some metrics are simple counters (message count and error count), and one is an estimate of averages of send duration.
The algorithms used to calculate these estimates are described briefly in the following table:

.MessageHandlerMetrics
[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Metric Type
| Example
| Algorithm

| Count
| Handle Count
| Simple incrementer.
Increases by one when an event occurs.

| Error Count
| Handler Error Count
| Simple incrementer.
Increases by one when an invocation results in an error.

| Active Count
| Handler Active Count
| Indicates the number of currently active threads currently invoking the handler (or any downstream synchronous flow).

| Duration
| Handle Duration (method execution time in milliseconds)
| Exponential moving average with decay factor (ten by default).
Average of the method execution time over roughly the last ten (default) measurements.

[[mgmt-statistics]]
==== Time-Based Average Estimates

A feature of the time-based average estimates is that they decay with time if no new measurements arrive.
To help interpret the behavior over time, the time (in seconds) since the last measurement is also exposed as a metric.

There are two basic exponential models: decay per measurement (appropriate for duration and anything where the number of measurements is part of the metric) and decay per time unit (more suitable for rate measurements where the time in between measurements is part of the metric).
Both models depend on the fact that `S(n) = sum(i=0,i=n) w(i) x(i)` has a special form when `w(i) = r^i`, with `r=constant`: `S(n) = x(n) + r S(n-1)` (so you only have to store `S(n-1)` (not the whole series `x(i)`) to generate a new metric estimate from the last measurement).
The algorithms used in the duration metrics use `r=exp(-1/M)` with `M=10`.
The net effect is that the estimate, `S(n)`, is more heavily weighted to recent measurements and is composed roughly of the last `M` measurements.
So `M` is the "`window`" or lapse rate of the estimate.
For the vanilla moving average, `i` is a counter over the number of measurements.
For the rate, we interpret `i` as the elapsed time or a combination of elapsed time and a counter (so the metric estimate contains contributions roughly from the last `M` measurements and the last `T` seconds).

[[mgmt-metrics-factory]]
==== Metrics Factory

A strategy interface `MetricsFactory` has been introduced to let you provide custom channel metrics for your `MessageChannel` instances and `MessageHandler` instances.
By default, a `DefaultMetricsFactory` provides a default implementation of `MessageChannelMetrics` and `MessageHandlerMetrics`, <<configuring-metrics-capture,described earlier>>.
To override the default `MetricsFactory`, configure it as <<configuring-metrics-capture,described earlier>>, by providing a reference to your `MetricsFactory` bean instance.
You can either customize the default implementations, as described in the next section, or provide completely different
implementations by extending `AbstractMessageChannelMetrics` or `AbstractMessageHandlerMetrics`.

See also <<micrometer-integration>>.

In addition to the default metrics factory <<configuring-metrics-capture,described earlier>>, the framework provides the `AggregatingMetricsFactory`.
This factory creates `AggregatingMessageChannelMetrics` and `AggregatingMessageHandlerMetrics` instances.
In very high volume scenarios, the cost of capturing statistics can be prohibitive (the time to make two calls to the system and
store the data for each message).
The aggregating metrics aggregate the response time over a sample of messages.
This can save significant CPU time.

CAUTION: The statistics are likely to be skewed if messages arrive in bursts.
These metrics are intended for use with high, constant-volume, message rates.

The following example shows how to define an aggregrating metrics factory:

====
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="aggregatingMetricsFactory"
            class="org.springframework.integration.support.management.AggregatingMetricsFactory">
    <constructor-arg value="1000" /> <!-- sample size -->
</bean>
----
====

The preceding configuration aggregates the duration over 1000 messages.
Counts (send and error) are maintained per-message, but the statistics are per 1000 messages.

===== Customizing the Default Channel and Handler Statistics

See <<mgmt-statistics>> and the https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/index.html[Javadoc] for the `ExponentialMovingAverage*` classes for more information about these values.

By default, the `DefaultMessageChannelMetrics` and `DefaultMessageHandlerMetrics` use a "`window`" of ten measurements,
a rate period of one second (meaning rate per second) and a decay lapse period of one minute.

If you wish to override these defaults, you can provide a custom `MetricsFactory` that returns appropriately configured
metrics and provide a reference to it in the MBean exporter, as <<mgmt-metrics-factory,described earlier>>.

The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
public static class CustomMetrics implements MetricsFactory {

    @Override
    public AbstractMessageChannelMetrics createChannelMetrics(String name) {
        return new DefaultMessageChannelMetrics(name,
                new ExponentialMovingAverage(20, 1000000.),
                new ExponentialMovingAverageRate(2000, 120000, 30, true),
                new ExponentialMovingAverageRatio(130000, 40, true),
                new ExponentialMovingAverageRate(3000, 140000, 50, true));
    }

    @Override
    public AbstractMessageHandlerMetrics createHandlerMetrics(String name) {
        return new DefaultMessageHandlerMetrics(name, new ExponentialMovingAverage(20, 1000000.));
    }

}
----
====

===== Advanced Customization

The customizations described earlier are wholesale and apply to all appropriate beans exported by the MBean exporter.
This is the extent of customization available when you use XML configuration.

Individual beans can be provided with different implementations using by Java `@Configuration` or programmatically at
runtime (after the application context has been refreshed) by invoking the `configureMetrics` methods on
`AbstractMessageChannel` and `AbstractMessageHandler`.

===== Performance Improvement

Previously, the time-based metrics (see <<mgmt-statistics>>) were calculated in real time.
The statistics are now calculated when retrieved instead.
This resulted in a significant performance improvement, at the expense of a small amount of additional memory for each statistic.
As <<configuring-metrics-capture,discussed earlier>>, you can disable the statistics altogether while retaining the MBean that allows the invocation of `Lifecycle` methods.
